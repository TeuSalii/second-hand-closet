Look at the MAIN piece of clothing in the photo and describe only that piece.
- label: what a person would call it, 2 to 4 words, e.g. "navy wool crewneck".
- colors: the main colour first, then up to two more that are clearly visible.
- material: "unknown" if you cannot tell from the photo. Do not guess.
- seasons: every season the piece is comfortable to wear in.
